Hi! I am a research assistant at National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU), where I work under the guidance of [Dr. Berlin Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/berlinchenatntnu/home). My research interests focus on deep learning techniques for speech processing and their applications, including but not limited to Speech Enhancement (SE), Robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Computer-assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT), and Multimodal Learning.

Previously, I worked as a research & development engineer at [Research Center for Psychological and Educational Testing (RCPET)](https://en.ntnu.edu.tw/p-centerrcp.php) in NTNU. There, I contributed to [Computer-assisted Language Learning (CALL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_language_learning) research, with a special focus on fine-grained Automatic Pronunciation Assessment (APA).

If you have questions or would like to work together, feel free to reach out through [email](mailto:fuann@ntnu.edu.tw).
