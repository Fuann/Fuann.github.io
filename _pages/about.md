Hi! I am a research assistant at National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU), where I work with [Dr. Berlin Chen](https://sites.google.com/site/berlinchenatntnu/home). My research interest broadly covers the deep learning technique for speech processing and its applications, such as Speech Enhancement (SE), Robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Computer-assisted Pronunciation Training (CAPT), and Multimodal Learning.

Previously, I was a research & development engineer at [Research Center for Psychological and Educational Testing (RCPET)](https://en.ntnu.edu.tw/p-centerrcp.php) in NTNU, working on [Computer-assisted Language Learning (CALL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_language_learning) research with a special focus on fine-grained Automatic Pronunciation Assessment (APA).

If you have questions or would like to work together, feel free to reach out through [email](mailto:fuann@ntnu.edu.tw).
