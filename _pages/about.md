I am an Associate Research Engineer at [Research Center for Psychological and Educational Testing (RCPET)](https://en.ntnu.edu.tw/p-centerrcp.php) in National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU), working on [Computer-assisted Language Learning (CALL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_language_learning) research. Currently, I have a special focus on fine-grained Automatic Pronunciation Assessment (APA).

Previously, I was a graduate student in the Computer Science and Information Engineering Department at National Taiwan Normal University, co-advised by [Berlin Chen](https://scholar.google.com.tw/citations?user=-2c31OsAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Jeih-weih Hung](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hDNxuvYAAAAJ&hl=zh-TW). My graduate research focused on developing algorithms for Speech Enhancement (SE) and their applications to noise-robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
